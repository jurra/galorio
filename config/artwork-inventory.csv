"When love finally wakes up
",ABS-0018,COLL-0001,,,,,Big,x,101.6×152.4,,"Sacred price is 3333 and it means:  

Angel number 3333 embodies expansion, creation, and the multiplying force of energy in motion. In numerology, 3 is the number of growth, amplification, and expression. When repeated, it speaks of momentum—something that starts small but builds into something greater, where unity leads to creation. It carries the essence of a force that cannot be contained, something that unfolds and extends beyond itself.  

This piece is part of *Who Looks Inside, Awakes*, a collection that rejects dualism and embraces the raw unity of existence—where erotic energy, struggle, and mystery are all part of the same force. It captures a moment of deep physical connection, where the act of love is not just a meeting but an expansion, a rhythmic build-up of energy that demands release. Bodies merge and press into one another, not in stillness but in movement, in tension, in the pulse of something growing between them.  

The imagery suggests an opening, a widening, an urgency—an invitation into something both physical and primal. The repetition of form mirrors the number’s meaning: the way touch turns into pressure, pressure into need, need into something that cannot be undone. It is the moment where pleasure swells and crests, where arousal reaches beyond itself, where two do not just remain two—but become something more.  

Like all works in this collection, it isn’t just made to be looked at—it’s meant to be felt. The question is, what does it awaken in you?"
